                    <li>This relatively narrow interval indicates a reliable forecast for the Italy market.</li>

                    <li>Budget allocations should include flexibility to adjust based on actual performance within this range.</li>

                    <li><strong>Cost Concerns (46%, +9pp)</strong>: The significant increase is concerning and suggests deteriorating price perception. Marketing should focus on value messaging and competitive pricing compared to other luxury destinations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Restrictive Laws/Customs (37%, +10pp)</strong>: The substantial increase suggests growing concerns about cultural restrictions. Marketing should highlight the tourist-friendly environment and recent relaxations in laws affecting visitors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Concerns (30%, +2pp)</strong>: The slight increase is concerning but not dramatic. Marketing should emphasize Abu Dhabi's high safety rankings and positive safety experiences of visitors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative Experiences (25%, +7pp)</strong>: The increase suggests deteriorating word-of-mouth. Marketing should showcase positive testimonials from Italian travelers and address common concerns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age Perception (24%, +23pp)</strong>: The dramatic increase is alarming and suggests a significant shift in perception. Marketing should urgently showcase Abu Dhabi as a destination for all ages, highlighting activities for younger travelers.</li>
